# PRODIGY_CS_05
Educational packet sniffer tool using Python to analyze network packet headers.
# Packet Sniffer Tool – Cyber Security Internship Task 5

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a basic Packet Sniffer Tool developed using Python. It captures and analyzes network packet header information in a controlled and authorized environment for educational purposes.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how network packets are structured and how packet capturing works in networking.

## ⚙️ Features
- Captures network packets
- Displays Source IP address
- Displays Destination IP address
- Identifies Protocol type (TCP/UDP)
- Shows Source and Destination ports
- Displays Packet length
- Captures limited packets for demonstration

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Scapy Library
- Networking Fundamentals

## 📚 Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
- Basics of TCP/IP protocols
- Packet structure analysis
- Network monitoring concepts
- Importance of ethical cybersecurity practices

## ⚠️ Ethical Disclaimer
This project is developed strictly for educational purposes.  
It should only be used on networks where proper authorization is granted.  
Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical.
