Task 5: Packet Sniffer Tool

Task Description:
Develop a packet sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. The tool should display relevant information such as source IP address, destination IP address, protocol type, and port numbers.

Implementation:
In this project, I developed a basic packet sniffer using Python and the Scapy library. The tool captures a limited number of packets and extracts header-level information including IP addresses, protocol type (TCP/UDP), ports, and packet size.

Purpose:
The purpose of this task was to understand how network packets are structured and how packet capturing works in real-world networking environments.

Note:
This project was developed strictly for educational purposes and tested only in an authorized environment.
